//! Phase 0 toy crate. The Aegis loop is allowed to rewrite this file; the
//! Kani harness in `src/harness.rs` and the integration tests in
//! `tests/integration.rs` are locked.

#![allow(clippy::needless_return)]

// LOCKED: do not remove. The orchestrator re-injects this declaration if a
// patch drops it, but keeping it here means the example builds under
// `cargo kani` without orchestrator help.
